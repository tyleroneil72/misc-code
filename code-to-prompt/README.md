## Description

A Bash script that recursively processes all files within a specified directory, appending each file's full relative path and contents to a single output file, prompt.txt. This script is designed to facilitate easy prompting of ChatGPT with the complete code of your project files. Each entry in prompt.txt begins with the file's relative path, followed by its contents, and concludes with two extra blank lines for separation.
