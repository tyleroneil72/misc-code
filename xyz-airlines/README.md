## Description
Designed as part of an Advanced Object-Oriented Programming course, this C# application exemplifies key OOP principles including Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Association, and Aggregation. Accompanied by a comprehensive [`UML Diagram`](https://github.com/tyleroneil72/misc-code/blob/main/xyz-airlines/UML/UML.png), this console-based program serves as an airline operations management tool. It enables the creation and management of customers, flights, and bookings, all persistently stored in local text files, ensuring data continuity across sessions.
